  Declaring Opposite Directionality
</h1>



<h2>The Problem</h2>
When visible text whose directionality is the opposite of the current directionality context
(e.g. Arabic text in an English UI) is not explicitly declared as such,
it may be displayed garbled.
Here are some of the most common garbling cases:<br>
<br>

<br>
This happens because internally, all the text is stored in <i>logical</i> order, the order in which the characters are meant to be read.
The visual layout -
whether the next character or word goes to the left or right of the one before it,
and the glyphs used for directional punctuation such as parentheses -
is a function of the standard <a target="_blank" href="http://unicode.org/reports/tr9/">Unicode BiDi algorithm</a>,
as implemented by browsers and other platforms.
To get good results, this algorithm uses not only the innate, well-defined directionality of specific characters,
but also metadata:
the overall directionality of the text,
and the exact boundaries of any embedded opposite-directionality phrases.
Although it makes a brave attempt to function well in the absence of directionality metadata,
in the cases above it simply can't.
<br />
<br />
<h2>What To Do</h2>
<h3>Declare Directionality</h3>
The directionality of all opposite-directionality phrases needs to be explicitly declared.
<br />
<br />
In HTML, the usual way to declare directionality is with the dir attribute,
e.g. <code>&lt;span <b>dir=ltr</b>&gt;Hello world!&lt;/span&gt;</code>.
It is also the right way to do it.
Although a CSS attribute (e.g. <code>style="direction: ltr"</code>) can also be used to declare text directionality,
this property of the text is not purely decorative in function,
and its use is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-bidi-css-markup">discouraged by the W3C</a>
for this purpose.
<br />
<br />
However, there are places in an HTML document, like inside the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;option&gt;</code> elements,
that mark-up is not allowed and directionality can not be declared using the methods above.
Here, as in plain text documents, the only way to do it is using Unicode formatting characters:
either LRE ("left-to-right embedding", U+202A) or RLE ("right-to-left embedding", U+202B)
at the beginning of the opposite-directionality phrase,
and PDF ("pop directional formatting", U+202C) at the end,
e.g. <code><b>\u202A</b>Hello world!<b>\u202C</b></code>.
<br>
<br>
LRE/RLE/PDF currently also work elsewhere in an HTML document,
but their use is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-bidi-controls.en.php">highly discouraged</a> by the W3C
except where mark-up is not allowed.
It is especially problematic <i>around</i> mark-up, or when not properly balanced.
In the future, browsers may start ignoring LRE/RLE/PDF in inappropriate contexts.
<br>
<br>
In addition to LRE/RLE/PDF, another couple of Unicode formatting characters,
LRM ("left-to-right mark", U+200E) and RLM ("right-to-left mark", U+200F),
can also be used to fix many of the garbles above.
However, they do <i>not</i> declare directionality.
They are simply zero-width characters with strong directionality, like an invisible A or א,
and putting one of them at the beginning and end of a phrase (according to the phrase's directionality)
means there can be no leading or trailing punctuation or numbers, and thus fixes those garbles.
However, they do <i>not</i> fix the "embedded opposite" garble.
Although LRM and RLM are useful for <a target="_blank"
    href="resetting-directionality.html"
>another purpose</a>,
directionality declaration in a plain-text environment should be done with LRE/RLE/PDF, not LRM/RLM.
<br>
<br>
In summary, use <code>dir=ltr|rtl</code> wherever HTML mark-up is allowed.
Where it isn't, use LRE/RLE/PDF.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Estimate Directionality When It Isn't Known</h3>
Typically, directionality of potentially opposite-directionality data is unknown,
and thus has to be determined by examining the characters of the text.
It is a fairly cheap task, and is completely deterministic when the text does not mix LTR and RTL characters.
When the text is mixed, various heuristics can be used to estimate the overall directionality.
<br>
<br>
A few types of text data are always LTR:
<ul>
<li>Phone numbers</li>
<li>Other formatted numbers (leading sign, trailing percent, etc.)</li>
<li>URLs, paths, filenames, domain names, e-mail addresses, etc.</li>
<li>Source code: HTML source, script, etc.</li>
</ul>
These should not undergo directionality estimation,
for fear of erroneously deciding that they are RTL or neutral.
For example, the result of displaying "http://whatever/א" in RTL is <span dir=rtl>"http://whatever/א"</span>,
and of "C:\a\" is <span dir=rtl>"C:\a\"</span>.
<br>
<br>
Since HTML mark-up and entities (escape codes) use LTR characters,
it is important to ignore these when estimating the directionality of HTML excerpts or HTML-escaped text.
<br />
<br>
However, directionality estimation of full-blown HTML is far from perfect.
Ideally, rich text stored as HTML should declare its own directionality.
<br />
<br />
<h2>When To Do It</h2>
Opposite-directionality text typically makes its way into a UI as data to be displayed,
data whose language the UI does not control.
This is in contrast to localized content -
messages localized to the same language as the UI, whatever it may be.
Nevertheless, sometimes one does encounter "localized" boilerplate of opposite directionality (thus needing declaration),
for example "&copy; Copyright ..." notices in an RTL UI.
<br>
<br>
Perhaps suprisingly, most of the textual data displayed by a UI can be of the opposite directionality.
Even if, for example, the database providing the data is known to be all-LTR,
the same UI code may one day have to support an RTL UI.
Or, an additional data provider that does provide RTL data may have to be handled.
It pays to prepare for these eventualities when originally writing the UI code,
because it is typically a lot more expensive to do it later,
when it is no longer so clear what is localized and what isn't,
what has already had its directionality declared and what hasn't.<br>
<br>
Directionality should be declared immediately around the opposite-directionality phrase.
For example, if a Hebrew name is embedded in an English "by &lt;name&gt;" message,
it is only the name that should be declared as RTL - not the "by".
<u>Thus, directionality declaration is done at every point where code mixes text data
of potentially opposite directionality into localized output.</u>
In HTML, when no element encloses just the opposite-directionality phrase,
it is necessary to add a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> or some other element around the phrase
in order to declare its directionality.
<br />
<br />
If the text is indeed of the opposite directionality, declare it.
If not, ideally do nothing and keep the output as small and simple as possible.
<br>
<br>
Once a phrase's directionality has been declared, it should be treated as localized output,
and it - or any string into which it has been inserted - should not need to undergo directionality declaration again.
<br>
<br>
In many ways, the task of declaring directionality is similar to the task of HTML-escaping text before inserting it into HTML.
The code needs to know what string has been escaped (or is safe HTML), and what string still needs to be escaped.
The same way, the code needs to know what string is localized and thus does not need directionality declaration,
and what string is potentially of opposite directionality,
and must have its directionality declared (if opposite) before being inserted into localized output.
<br />
<br />
Many or most of the points where potentially opposite-directionality text is inserted into localized output occur in templates,
so template systems are a natural place to add APIs for declaring directionality -
just as they are a natural place to do HTML escaping.
