  Declaring Page Directionality
</h1>



<h2>The Problem</h2>
Simply translating the text of a document into an RTL language does not make it an RTL document.
As long as the document still has LTR directionality, which is the default,
it will have the following LTR properties:
<ul>
<li>
Lines will be left-aligned by default.
</li>
<li>
Table columns will be arranged left-to-right.
</li>
<li>
Any "neutral" items - punctuation, images, inputs, etc. -
at the beginning of a line will be placed at its left end,
while those at the end will be placed on the right,
garbling the line.
</li>
</ul>
Here is an example:
<br />
<br />
<table style="border-color: rgb(136, 136, 136); border-width: 1px; border-collapse: collapse;" border="1" bordercolor="#888888" cellspacing="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="width: 200px; height: 35px; text-align: center; font-weight:bold">Intended RTL Page...</td>
<td style="width: 200px; height: 35px; text-align: center; font-weight:bold">...Garbled as LTR</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td dir=rtl style="padding:10px">

<td style="font-weight:bold">שם</td>
<td style="font-weight:bold">טל'</td>

The result is a thoroughly broken document:
just like RTL text is supposed to flow right-to-left,
the overall layout of a document in an RTL language is supposed to flow right-to-left.
Generally, an item that "belongs" on the left side of an LTR page
belongs on the right in an RTL page, and vice-versa;
the page is supposed to be "mirrored".
Nevertheless, to someone who does not read the language,
it looks no worse than any other foreign language page.
In fact it looks less foreign than in its correct RTL directionality!
This makes this problem a suprisingly common occurrence even in production pages.
<br />
<br />
<h2>What To Do</h2>
For an RTL HTML page, page directionality must be explicitly declared:
<code>&lt;body dir=rtl&gt;</code>.
Since the directionality of an element by default propagates to all its descendants,
this will:
<ul>
<li>Make text throughout the page right-aligned by default.</li>
<li>Lay out table columns right-to-left.</li>
<li>Lay out the neutral items like images and punctuation at the beginning of a block element on the right and those at the end on the left.</li>
</ul>
This goes a long way towards mirroring the page's layout.
Note, however, that the page's CSS and <code>align</code> attributes
may still contain many absolute "left" and "right" instructions,
each of which must be mirrored separately.
Similarly, "handed" images that somehow point left or right will point the wrong way in the new layout,
and must therefore be flipped.
And changing the page's directionality to RTL will also make RTL some things that need to stay LTR,
e.g. formatted numbers.
Thus, mirroring a page typically involves a number of steps beyond setting its overall directionality,
but it's a good start.
<br />
<br />
The <code>dir=rtl</code> will have very similar effects when applied at any of three different levels:
<ul>
<li>
<code>&lt;body dir=rtl&gt;</code> -
The usual approach.
In IE (and only in IE) will put the page's scrollbar on the left.</li>
<li>
<code>&lt;body&gt;&lt;div dir=rtl&gt;</code>...<code>&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</code> -
same as <code>&lt;body dir=rtl&gt;</code>, but will leave the page's scrollbar in its usual place.
</li>
<li>
<code>&lt;html dir=rtl&gt;</code> -
same as <code>&lt;body dir=rtl&gt;</code>, but, in principle, should also apply to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>,
including the <code>title</code>.
Unfortunately, this is <i>not</i> the case in all current browsers (IE8, Forefox 3.5, Chrome 3, etc.),
and it has exactly the same effect as <code>&lt;body dir=rtl&gt;</code>.
This should hopefully change in future browser versions.
</li>
</ul>
As mentioned above, setting the page's directionality does <i>not</i> set it for the page's <code>title</code> element.
Neither does it affect the dialogs produced by the page's script (e.g. the <code>alert</code> and <code>confirm</code> JavaScript functions).
Instead, the title and dialogs appear in the operating system's directionality context, which may be either LTR or RTL,
and which the page has no way to control or even determine.
As a result, these are often garbled when RTL,
unless explicitly declared as such using Unicode formatting characters
(see <a target="_blank"
href="declaring-opposite-directionality.html"
>Declaring Opposite Directionality</a>).
Although in principle the same is true for LTR titles and dialogs when the operating system's directionality context is RTL,
it is important <i>not</i> to use Unicode formatting characters for them in an LTR page,
since most LTR systems will erroneously display these characters.
(This is not a concern for RTL pages because their RTL titles and dialogs will not be displayed directly by such LTR systems anyway.)
Thus, it is best to assume that the context for titles and dialogs is always LTR.
<br />
<br />
<h2>When To Do It</h2>
You must declare a document to have RTL directionality when it is, overall, in an RTL language.
Many platforms have APIs that, given a language code or locale object, return its directionality.
It is unnecessary to declare LTR directionality, since it is the default.
<br />
<br />
<h2>Toolkit</h2>
The following APIs are useful for determining and declaring page directionality:
<ul>
  <li>Template systems</li>
  <ul>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="http://code.google.com/closure/templates/docs/bidi_support.html">Closure Templates</a></li>
    <ul>
      <li>bidiGlobalDir() < 0 - condition checking whether the page locale is RTL</li>
      <li>{bidiGlobalDir() < 0 ? 'dir=rtl' : ''} - evaluates to <code>dir=rtl</code> for an RTL locale page, empty string otherwise</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>GWT</li>
  <ul>
    <li>GWT automatically mirrors page layout for RTL locales, including setting the page directionality
    </li>
    <li>
      Use
      <a target="_blank"
         href="http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/1.6/com/google/gwt/i18n/client/LocaleInfo.html"
      >com.google.gwt.i18n.client.LocaleInfo</a>'s
      <code>getCurrentLocale().isRTL()</code> to determine whether the current locale is RTL.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Closure's <a target="_blank"
      href="http://code.google.com/p/closure-library/source/browse/trunk/closure/goog/i18n/bidi.js"
      >goog.i18n.bidi</a></li>
    <ul>
      <li>isRtlLanguage - whether a language is RTL</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
