  Resetting Directionality
</h1>



<h2>The Problem</h2>
While <a
href="declaring-opposite-directionality.html"
>declaring an opposite-directionality phrase</a>
makes sure that the phrase itself is displayed properly,
the presence of such a phrase, despite its declaration, may still cause severe garbling of what follows it in-line.
Fortunately, this kind of garbling, which is also known as spillover,
only happens when the opposite-directionality text is followed
(possibly after some intervening neutral characters) by one of just two kinds of characters:
<br>
<br>
<table style="border-color: rgb(136, 136, 136); border-width: 1px; border-collapse: collapse" border="1" bordercolor="#888888" cellspacing="0">

<td style="padding-left:5px"><span dir=rtl>פיקאסו</span><span style="background-color: Yellow">
(</span><a href="#"><span style="background-color: Yellow">3</span> reviews</a>)</td>

<td style="padding-left:5px"><code>Documents &amp;gt;
<br />Hebrew &amp;gt;
<br />&lt;span dir=rtl&gt;חומש&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt;
<br />&lt;span dir=rtl&gt;בראשית&lt;/span&gt;</code></td>
<td style="padding-left:5px">Documents &gt; Hebrew &gt; <span dir=rtl>חומש</span>&lrm; &gt; <span dir=rtl>בראשית</span></td>

<br />
Spillover happens because the <a target="_blank" href="http://unicode.org/reports/tr9/">Unicode BiDi algorithm</a>
combines the opposite-directionality phrase
and the following number or second opposite-directionality phrase
(as well as any intervening neutral characters like whitespace and punctuation)
into a single opposite-directionality run.
When the opposite directionality phrase is not explicitly declared, and thus its actual end is unclear,
this behaviour makes sense,
making sure that strings like "February 2008" and "x < x + 1"
display the same way in an both LTR and RTL contexts
(instead of as "<span dir=rtl>February&rlm; 2008</span>" and "<span dir=rtl>x&rlm; < x&rlm; + 1</span>" in RTL).
That this behaviour persists when the extent of the opposite-directionality area is explicitly declared
appears to be a shortcoming of the algorithm, faithfully reproduced by all known implementations.
<br />
<br />
<h2>What To Do</h2>
To prevent spillover, directionality must be explicitly reset after the opposite-directionality phrase back to the overall context,
breaking the opposite-directionality run.
There are three known ways to do so - but only one works completely reliably:
<br />
<br>

<br />
The reliable method consists of placing an LRM character ("left-to-right mark", U+200E)
after an RTL phrase in an LTR context,
and RLM ("right-to-left mark", U+200F) after an LTR phrase in an RTL context.
These are simply zero-width characters with strong directionality, like an invisible A and א, respectively.
<br />
<br />
Why look for more methods when we have one that works reliably and takes the least space possible?
Because using LRM and RLM characters has some <b style="font-weight: bold">mildly undesirable side-effects</b>
that we would prefer to avoid.
Although we do use LRM and RLM to reset directionality for lack of a reliable alternative,
it is important to at least avoid putting them in when they are unnecessary.
At the very minimum, a page that is entirely LTR should not contain any LRM or RLM characters.
<br />
<br />
<h2>When To Do It</h2>
Spillover happens when all of the following come together:
<ul>
<li>
<b>An opposite-directionality phrase</b>.
As we have seen, declaring an opposite-directionality phrase does not prevent spillover.
In fact, once a phrase has been declared to be of opposite directionality,
it will cause spillover even if it actually ends in a character of the outside directionality.
But neither is declaration required for spillover to happen.
Thus, even if the phrase is overall of the same directionality as the outside,
and thus does not need to be declared, it will still cause spillover if it happens to end in an opposite-directionality character.
As a result, to determine whether reset is needed after a phrase of unknown directionality,
we must not only check and declare its overall directionality,
but also its <i>exit directionality</i> - the directionality of its last strongly-directional character.
For example, the Hebrew sentence "<span dir=rtl>מצתרפים למהפכת ה-HTML!</span>" happens to end in LTR characters,
and can cause spillover when inserted into a Hebrew UI (where it does not need declaration).
It can also cause spillover in an English UI, even though it ends in LTR characters,
because it would be declared as RTL overall.
Thus, it needs directionality reset in both contexts!
As a result of this complexity,
one is often tempted to take it easy
and reset directionality after every unknown-directionality string,
regardless of its overall or exit directionality.
Unfortunately, this leads to LRM characters appearing needlessly in all-LTR pages,
something we want to avoid.
The bottom line is that reset should only be done when either the overall or the exit directionality of a string
is opposite to the context.
</li>
<li>
<b>Followed by a number or another opposite-directionality phrase</b>
(possibly after some intervening neutral characters).
In practice, it is often difficult to know a-priori what kind of characters are going to follow
the opposite-directionality text.
Punctuation and whitespace, being neutral, are immaterial.
If what comes after that is localized text,
it could begin with a term that does not get translated, e.g. "HTML",
and thus can be of opposite directionality.
Or, it could begin with a number, even though in English the number might only occur later.
And if what comes after is another string of unknown directionality,
this may or may not turn out to be of opposite directionality - or start with a number.
It is thus best to ignore this condition when deciding whether reset is needed.
</li>
<li>
<b>Within the same "paragraph"</b>.
Spillover does not cross from one "paragraph" to another.
In HTML, a "paragraph" is any block element,
e.g. <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;td&gt;</code>, etc. -
unless it has been made inline by the <code>display:inline</code> style.
Thus, there is no spillover problem in
"<code>&lt;div&gt;1. His name is אהרון&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2. אהרון is his name&lt;/div&gt;</code>".
Note, however, that this does <i>not</i> mean that spillover is stopped
by an <i>embedded</i> block element
or a line-breaking element like <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code>
(which are not even considered to be block elements).
These stop spillover in IE and WebKit, but not in Forefox or Opera.
Thus, there <i>is</i> a spillover problem with "<code>1. His name is אהרון&lt;br&gt;2. אהרון is his name</code>"
and even with "<code>1. His name is אהרון&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;2. אהרון is his name</code>".
</li>
</ul>
LTR (usually English) words occur surprisingly frequently in localized RTL boilerplate,
where one normally would not expect them.
Examples include brands like "Google", technical acronyms like "HTTP" and "KB", URLs, and so on.
Often enough, these are the last words in the phrase and can thus cause spillover in what follows them.
It is thus sometimes necessary to reset directionality after localized boilerplate,
not just arbitrary-directionality data.
<br />
<br />
An important note of caution:
two (or more) successive strings sometimes are - and sometimes aren't -
a single logical entity,
and as such must <i>not</i> be broken up by a reset.
For example, in the following UI, the person's name and favorite programming language
are two logically separate entities
that require reset between them as described above
so that they are displayed in a consistent order:
<br />
<br />
<table style="border-color: rgb(136, 136, 136); border-width: 1px; border-collapse: collapse" border="1" bordercolor="#888888" cellspacing="0">

<br />

</code>
</td>
<td dir=rtl style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 15px; text-align: right">
<ul>
<li><b>דוד כהן</b> - Cobol</li>

</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="padding:5px; font-weight: bold">Bad (No Reset)</td>
<td style="padding:5px; vertical-align: middle">
<code>
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;דוד כהן&lt;/b&gt; - Cobol&lt;/li&gt;
<br />
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;John Doe&lt;/b&gt; - Fortran&lt;/li&gt;
</code>

<td dir=rtl style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 15px; text-align: right">
<ul>
<li><b>דוד כהן</b> - Cobol</li>
<li><b>John Doe</b><span style="background-color: Yellow"> - Fortran</span></li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br />
On the other hand, you do <i>not</i> want to reset directionality between the first and last names
when these happen to be given as separate values, since there is no logical break between them:
<br />
<br />
<table style="border-color: rgb(136, 136, 136); border-width: 1px; border-collapse: collapse" border="1" bordercolor="#888888" cellspacing="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td style="text-align: center">HTML (for RTL context)</td>
<td style="text-align: center">Result</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="padding:5px; font-weight: bold">Good (single entity)</td>
<td style="padding:5px; vertical-align: middle">
<code>
&lt;li&gt;דוד כהן&lt;/li&gt;
<br />
&lt;li&gt;John Doe&lt;/li&gt;
</code>
</td>
<td dir=rtl style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 15px; text-align: right">
<ul>
<li>דוד כהן</li>
<li>John Doe</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="padding:5px; font-weight: bold">Bad (two entities with reset between them)</td>
<td style="padding:5px; vertical-align: middle">
<code>
&lt;li&gt;דוד כהן&lt;/li&gt;
<br />
&lt;li&gt;John<span style="background-color: Yellow">&amp;rlm;</span> Doe&lt;/li&gt;
</code>
</td>
<td dir=rtl style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 15px; text-align: right">
<ul>
<li>דוד כהן</li>
<li>John&rlm;<span style="background-color: Yellow"> Doe</span></li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br />
(For clarity, the <code>&lt;span dir=ltr&gt;</code>'s have been omitted in the two examples above.
They would not have made any difference in the result anyway.)
<br />
<br />
Differentiating between the two situations is not always easy,
and is sometimes more of a judgement call.
It is not whether the two strings are instrinsically separate entities or parts of a single one,
but how the UI layout, e.g. style and punctuation, seems to want to show them.
<br />
<br />
When the two strings are a single logical entity, the preferable solution is to process them as a single entity,
not to simply omit the reset between them.
This not only save the bytes of a second a <code>&lt;span dir=...&gt;</code>,
but prevents garbling when punctuation (like parentheses or quotes) surrounds the second string
without being included in its <code>&lt;span dir=...&gt;</code>.
Thus, we still recommend resetting directionality after every opposite-directionality string
(possibly except when it is at the end of a "paragraph");
the trick is combining a sequence of opposite-directionality strings that are really a single logical entity
into a single opposite-directionality string.
